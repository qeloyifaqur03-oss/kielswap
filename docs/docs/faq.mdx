### Is execution guaranteed?
No. Execution is conditional on market conditions and constraints.

### Why not always use instant execution?
Instant execution optimizes for speed, not outcome quality.

### Can intents be cancelled?
Yes. Intents expire automatically and are not enforced beyond constraints.

### Does Kielswap act as a counterparty?
No. Execution uses existing on-chain liquidity.
