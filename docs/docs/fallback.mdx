description: "Optional fallback paths when intents cannot fill."

Not all intents can be fulfilled optimally within their constraints.

In such cases, Kielswap may offer fallback execution.

Fallback execution:
- prioritizes completion
- uses simpler execution paths
- may sacrifice optimization

Fallback is optional and explicit.
The user retains control over whether it is used.
