Kielswap is non-custodial.

Assumptions:
- users sign all execution authority
- funds move only via signed constraints
- execution relies on existing on-chain infrastructure

The system does not:
- custody assets
- maintain balances
- guarantee execution success

Security evolves alongside execution capabilities.
