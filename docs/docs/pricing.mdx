title: "Pricing, estimation, and slippage"
description: "How estimates and guaranteed minimums are used."
---

All displayed prices represent estimated execution outcomes.

Estimates account for:
- swap fees
- bridge costs
- execution overhead

The guaranteed minimum represents the lowest acceptable result after fees.

If the market cannot satisfy this minimum:
- execution does not proceed

There is no post-signature slippage beyond the defined constraints.
