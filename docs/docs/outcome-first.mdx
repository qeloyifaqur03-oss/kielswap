title: "Outcome-first execution model"
description: "Constraints define the valid execution space."
---

An outcome in Kielswap is defined by three constraints:

1. **Input**  
   What you are willing to spend.

2. **Output**  
   The minimum amount you are willing to receive.

3. **Time**  
   How long the system is allowed to attempt execution.

These constraints form a bounded execution space.

Any execution path that satisfies all three constraints is valid.
Any path that violates one is rejected.

This model allows:
- flexible routing
- solver competition
- dynamic execution strategies

without requiring user intervention.
