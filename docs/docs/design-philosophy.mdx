description: "Why Kielswap hides execution mechanics and centers outcomes."
---

Kielswap is built around one core idea:

**users should define outcomes, not execution mechanics.**

Traditional DeFi interfaces expose internal complexity:
- routes
- bridges
- liquidity sources
- partial execution steps

This pushes responsibility onto the user.

Kielswap intentionally hides these mechanics unless they matter.

The system is designed to:
- minimize cognitive load
- align incentives around final outcomes
- reduce exposure to unnecessary execution detail
- allow execution logic to evolve without changing the user interface

Execution complexity belongs to the system — not the user.
