Deadlines are a hard boundary.

They serve two purposes:
- limit market exposure
- bound solver behavior

Once a deadline is reached:
- execution is halted
- no further attempts are made
- the intent becomes invalid

Deadlines protect users from:
- indefinite execution attempts
- unfavorable market drift
- stale routing assumptions
