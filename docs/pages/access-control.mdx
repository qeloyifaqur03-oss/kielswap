Kielswap is currently gated via access codes.

This allows:
- controlled rollout
- execution quality monitoring
- infrastructure scaling under real usage

Early Access participants may receive:
- fee-free execution credits
- early visibility into execution behavior
- influence on execution design decisions

Access codes are single-use and securely validated.
