Intent-based execution optimizes for outcome quality, not immediacy.

Compared to instant swaps:
- execution may take longer
- routing may be less obvious
- multiple attempts may be evaluated

This tradeoff exists to:
- reduce price impact
- avoid rushed execution
- improve total execution quality

Users control this tradeoff via deadlines.
