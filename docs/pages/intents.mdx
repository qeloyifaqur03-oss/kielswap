description: "A signed declaration of constraints, not a route."

An intent is a signed declaration of constraints.

It is not:
- a transaction
- a route
- a promise of execution

Instead, it authorizes execution *only if* constraints are satisfied.

Key properties:
- the intent is signed once
- execution may involve multiple on-chain steps
- funds move strictly according to the signed intent
- the intent expires automatically after its deadline

This allows execution logic to operate independently while remaining fully user-authorized.
