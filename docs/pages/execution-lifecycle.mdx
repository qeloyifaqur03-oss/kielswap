title: "Execution lifecycle"
description: "How intents progress from acceptance to completion."
---

Each intent progresses through a defined lifecycle:

### 1. Intent accepted
The system validates constraints and registers the intent.

### 2. Route evaluation
Potential execution paths are evaluated across supported networks and liquidity sources.

### 3. Execution attempt
The system attempts execution that satisfies all constraints.

### 4. Completion or expiry
- If execution succeeds → the intent is fulfilled.
- If the deadline is reached → the intent expires without execution.

At no point does execution continue beyond the defined constraints.
