This documentation describes the execution model, guarantees, and design principles behind Kielswap.

It is not a marketing overview and not a step-by-step tutorial.

The goal is to explain:
- how outcome-first execution works in practice
- what guarantees exist — and what does not
- how intent-based execution differs from traditional swap flows
- how to reason about execution quality, deadlines, and failure modes

If you are looking for interface instructions, refer to the app directly.
