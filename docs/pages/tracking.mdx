title: "Execution tracking and observability"
description: "Tracking is high-level by design."

Each intent includes a tracking timeline.

The timeline shows:
- intent acceptance
- route search
- execution attempt
- final status

Tracking is intentionally high-level.

Internal solver competition and routing heuristics are abstracted away unless relevant.
