title: "Private execution and MEV exposure"
description: "Reducing MEV exposure where possible."
---

Public mempools expose execution intent.

Where possible, Kielswap prefers private execution paths to reduce:
- sandwich attacks
- transaction reordering
- information leakage

Private execution availability depends on:
- network support
- route structure
- execution strategy

Privacy is opportunistic, not guaranteed.
